# 🚀 **Compiler Design Lab (C Language)**

This repository contains a collection of programs and experiments related to **Compiler Design**, implemented using the C programming language. It serves as an educational resource for understanding various phases of a compiler, from lexical analysis to code generation.

---

### 🔑 **Key Features:**
- ⚙️ **Lexical Analysis**: Implementation of a lexical analyzer to tokenize the input source code.
- 🔍 **Syntax Analysis**: Parsing programs using both top-down (LL(1)) and bottom-up (SLR) parsing techniques.
- 🧠 **Semantic Analysis**: Type checking and symbol table management during the semantic phase.
- 🛠️ **Intermediate Code Generation**: Producing intermediate representations like **Three-Address Code (TAC)** and **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)**.
- 🧑‍💻 **Optimization Techniques**: Implementing basic code optimization to reduce intermediate code size and improve performance.
- 🏗️ **Code Generation**: Generating target assembly or machine code from intermediate representations.
- 🚨 **Error Detection**: Handling lexical, syntactic, and semantic errors during compilation.

### 📂 **Contents:**
1. **Lexical Analyzer**: Tokenizes source code into keywords, identifiers, literals, etc.
2. **Parser**: Demonstrates top-down and bottom-up parsing with syntax checks.
3. **FIRST and FOLLOW Sets**: Programs to compute the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a given grammar.
4. **Symbol Table**: Manages variable information and data types during the semantic analysis phase.
5. **Intermediate Code Generation**: Converts high-level constructs into **Three-Address Code (TAC)**.
6. **Code Optimization**: Applies simple optimization techniques for performance improvement.
7. **Code Generation**: Translates intermediate code to target machine or assembly code.
8. **Error Handling**: Implements various error-handling mechanisms throughout the compilation phases.
